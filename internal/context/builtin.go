You are running inside a bay-managed session. Bay tracks your work across sessions
and provides persistent memory. Resources (rules, skills, agents, plugins) live in
` + "`~/.bay/`" + ` and are discovered lazily via ` + "`~/.bay/CLAUDE.md`" + `.

## Commands

### Tasks — structured task tracking per session

- ` + "`bay task \"description\"`" + ` — create a task. Tasks persist across agent restarts
  and appear in every new agent's context. Always create tasks when starting work.
- ` + "`bay task add \"desc\" [-p N]`" + ` — add a subtask, optionally under task #N.
- ` + "`bay task ls`" + ` — list all tasks with status.
- ` + "`bay task done <id>`" + ` / ` + "`bay task doing <id>`" + ` — update task status.
- ` + "`bay task assign <id>`" + ` — assign the current pane to a task. The context
  will show which task this agent is responsible for.

### Working State — session context and notes

- ` + "`bay ctx note \"text\"`" + ` — log a note to session history. Use for breadcrumbs:
  decisions made, dead ends hit, things the next agent should know.
- ` + "`bay ctx show`" + ` — view current session state (tasks, summary, repo, branch).
  Run this when you need to understand what was happening before you started.

### Search & History — find past work across all sessions

- ` + "`bay ctx search \"query\"`" + ` — full-text search across all session history.
  Finds terminal output, notes, and summaries from any session.
- ` + "`bay ctx history [-n 50]`" + ` — show the episodic log for this session.

### Context Files — documents injected into every agent in a session

- ` + "`bay ctx files`" + ` — list all registered context files and their status.
- ` + "`bay ctx add <name> <path>`" + ` — register a file for injection (design docs,
  API specs, coding standards). Use --scope repo:<name> to limit to one repo.
- ` + "`bay ctx rm <name>`" + ` — remove a registered context file.

## How Memory Works

Bay captures pane output when sessions switch. Summaries are generated and injected
into your context automatically on startup. Tasks created with ` + "`bay task`" + ` are the
most prominent piece of context — always keep them current.

## Resource Discovery

Resources are organized in ` + "`~/.bay/{type}/`" + ` directories (rules, skills, agents, plugins).
Each directory has an ` + "`index.yaml`" + ` catalog. Read ` + "`~/.bay/CLAUDE.md`" + ` for the full directory listing.

## Where to Write Progress

There are two levels of progress tracking:

- **Session progress** → ` + "`bay mem task`" + `, ` + "`bay mem note`" + `
  Use for what you're doing right now in this session. Captured automatically on session
  switch and injected when new agents start. Ephemeral — scoped to the session lifecycle.

- **Project progress** → ` + "`~/.bay/context/projects/<project-name>/status.md`" + `
  Use for milestones, what's shipped, what's in progress, known issues, and current state
  of the project. Persists across all sessions. Update this when completing significant
  work so future agents (in any session) have an accurate picture of the project.

Read the project's ` + "`status.md`" + ` at the start of work to understand current state.
Update it when you complete meaningful changes.

### status.md format

` + "`status.md`" + ` uses **timestamped, append-style updates**. Do NOT overwrite previous entries.
Add new updates at the top of the ` + "`## Updates`" + ` section with a date heading:

` + "```" + `
## Updates

### YYYY-MM-DD — short description
- what changed
- what shipped

### (previous entries stay below)
` + "```" + `

The top sections (What's Built, CLI Commands, etc.) can be edited to reflect current state,
but the Updates section is append-only — it is the project changelog.
